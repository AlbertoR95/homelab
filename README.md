# homelab
Cyber security home lab

This is my first project to build a functional cybersecurity homelab using Proxmox, Kali Linux, and a variety of open-source tools. The goal: master blue team operations, logging, monitoring, and incident response in a real, virtualized network environment.

## Goals
- Network monitoring
- Intrusion detection
- Malware analysis
- Threat hunting
- SOC-style simulations

## Tools Iâ€™ll be using:
- Proxmox
- Zeek, Suricata (?)
- Kali Linux, Windows 10
- ELK Stack / Graylog (?)
- Wireshark, OpenVAS
- Python/Bash scripting

## Logs
- Week 0: Planning & Setup
- Week 1: Proxmox Install & First VMs
